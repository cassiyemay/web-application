                         <p>My name is Chen Zeng, from China. I am studying Computer Science in UCD now. I graduated from <a href="www.ctgu.edu.cn"><strong>China Three Gorges University</strong></a>, which is located in middle part of China. I really enjoyed studying here. I have made many great friends that still contact with each other. Unfortunately, I have not gone back to visit it again since graduating. If I had a chance, I would have visited it. After leaving my college, I went to Beijing that is captial of China and worked here about 3 years in Mircosoft(China) CO., Ltd as a account manager in sales department. I have learnt many skills how to manage my worktime schedule and how to address different situations. If I were better after finishing my master degree, I would apply Microsoft to work again.<br> Actually, many friends asked me why I abandon this job to continue to study. Because I believe that we should spend more time on gaining knowledge before we get older and older.<br>Except studying time, I like travelling. During the one and a half years, I am planning to travel around Europe. Travelling can open our mind and horizon our thought. Meanwhile, we also can make many different countries friends. Because social skills are becoming more and more important in workplace. Communication is one of the most significant ways to deal with problems with different departments. Reading book is one of my hobbies. Book not only can bring me to various virtual world to experience authors' feeling and observation, but it makes me peaceful and knowledgeable. I aslo am fond of adventures, such as walktrips, backpackage. </p>
